## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology, advised by Prof. Zining Zhu. Before beginning my Ph.D., I earned an M.S. in Spatial Economics from the University of Southern California and a B.Sc. in Mathematics with Statistics from Imperial College London.

My research interests include mechanistic interpretability, reasoning, and security for large language models (LLMs). Currently, I focus on the privacy vulnerabilities of LLMs, aiming to better understand how these models memorize and expose training data. I am also broadly interested in deep learning theory and optimization.
